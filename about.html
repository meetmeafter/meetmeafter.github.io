            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">Did you ever think about what you will be known for 100 years from now? What your future great-great-grandchildren will hear about you, if anything at all? Meet Me After gives every human alive today the chance to introduce themselves to the future - long after they’re gone. From your future great-great grandchild who won’t grow to hear your words of wisdom in-person to the curious stranger taking a stroll past your future grave marker seeing nothing but a stone, Meet Me After uses digital technology to achieve what was never possible before: a face-to-face meeting connecting the past to the present. Offer an overview of who you were, where you lived, describe how you met your loving spouse, or advice on how to make that famous family recipe of yours. Turn mourning into laughter by cracking a joke, tears into smiles as you comfort your loved ones and are able to tell them that you truly are with them always. With our interactive mode, a visitor can even press on pre-created questions that you answered and remotely engage with you. You can choose to create a legacy that isn’t silenced when you pass into the next life. When you walk through a cemetery today, what do you see? Miles of granite with birthdates and death-dates. But what future generations and passerby’s don’t get to see is your personality, your beloved pet, or fun hobby. Don’t wait to give the future what they want to see: the person - not the memorial.<div><br></div><div>You can choose to sit down with your spouse and let viewers feel the love through the screen on your shared, personalized Meet Me After legacy page. Imagine a day many years from now where schoolteachers can take their students on an educational field trip to meet locals who they would have never gotten the chance to know because of the fate of time. None of us will live forever - but all of us can and deserve to be remembered. No longer are the days of relying on a 50-word obituary to tell your entire life story. You are worth much more than words on a paper - we live in a day and age where you can be seen, heard, and cherished in perpetuity. &nbsp;</div><br><div>Don’t wait to enroll! You have the ability to change lives not in how you lived, but in how you preserved your life. Your thank you will come from many people who get the chance to meet you, in your life’s encore. <a href="enroll.html#pricing-tables3-c">Click here to start creating your legacy.</a></div><br><div><br></div></div>

                   Like everybody does at one point or another, I have long strolled around cemeteries to visit loved ones or just for a peaceful walk, wondering who the people were behind the gravestones. What was life like for them in the 19th century? What was their personality? What did they look like? What was it like serving in a World War?<br><br>These are questions that can - and deserve to be - asked of every human who once walked the Earth. It should be our collective disappointment that we've allowed their experiences and wisdom to disappear when they did.<br><br>Everyone has a story - and by starting <strong>Meet Me After</strong> - we're one step closer as a world to achieving a uniquely human, perpetual storytelling experience. This is just the beginning of breaking down the barrier of time that keeps generations of family, friends, and fellow humans disconnected. Join me on a movement: one where no person's legacy ever goes dark.</p>
